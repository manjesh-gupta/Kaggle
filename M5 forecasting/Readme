EDA.ipynb - plot ith series (by item and store) 

Created validation_values.csv to compare predictions for validation data
Evaluate.ipynb - copied code for calculating public leaderboard score WRRMSSE

Aggregated the series at store and department level and after prediction used 28 day historical proportions to forecast individual series
  Implemented prophet model 
    prophet.ipynb - exploring different time series with plots 
    prophet_full.ipynb - full model for submission, WRRMSSE (validation) - 0.79607

  Implemented gradient boosted regressor model 
    gbt.ipynb - exploring different time series with plots
    gbt_full - full model for submission, WRRMSSE (validation) - 0.70735
    

Predicting all series individually
    m5-lightgbm_eval.ipynb - Microsoft's LightGBM model to predict all (30490) series individually
    This is for final prediction for submission(evaluation set)
    This achived a private LB score of 0.63130 [214th out of 5558, Silver medal - Top 4%]
    WRRMSSE in validation phase was 0.54941
